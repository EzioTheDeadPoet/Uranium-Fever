:::important PATIENCE, COMPUTER EXPERIENCE, AND TIME ARE REQUIRED
UF's instructions are highly accessible for everyone, no matter your modding experience. You are still **REQUIRED** to carefully read through all the instructions even if you may think you are experienced enough to skip them. While, as stated above, you don't need any prior modding experience, it's still expected of you to be experienced with operating a computer in general.
