# ![Banner Sweet's Recommended Mods](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6aba5345-7873-45d3-b9b3-448df9a7cc59)

This list is written by Sweet6Shooter and covers **plugin-based** mods that Sweet considers important for her build and preferences, as well as added content she considers ostensibly indispensable.

:::warning 
- These are not all required for Sweet's suite of mods, and a number of them are a matter of taste.
- These are not listed in order of recommended load order - a number of them may have been custom patched for her build in a way that ameliorates load order considerations.
:::

**Indispensable:**
- RAD - Makes radiation much more consequential and is incredibly important.
- Just Assorted Mods
- JBT Improved
- Famine - [Sweet Config Settings](https://pastebin.com/wzWbUz6M)
- BURN - Hardcore Fire Effects
- TTW Quick Start
- Delay DLC Redux - AGE and DMT internally patched for this mod if it is present.
- Purchase Display - Many items placed in vendor areas in Sweet's mods are intended to be purchasable this way.
- Follower Formula Redone
- Simple Attack Reactions - NV+TTW - Makes combat much more responsive and less of a DPS race.
- JIP Companions Command & Control - Turn off companion health reset and infinite ammo.
- Enhanced Movement - Sprint system from this mod.
- Player Combat Priority - Ameliorates an extra degree of companion's making the game too easy.
 
**Miguick's suite of mods:**
- Armor Damage Overhaul - Absolutely crucial, makes apparel health more consequential. Without this mod, only body armor is damaged.
- Weapon Requirements System - Absolutely crucial, makes weapon requirements actually matter. - [Sweet Config Settings](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/79005?tab=files&file_id=1000130906&nmm=1)
- Reload Reloaded
- Power Attack Tweaks
- Critical Effect Fixes
- Crippled Limb Enforcer - Similar to Simple Attack Reactions
- Ammo Script Fixes
- NPC Addiction Fix - Prevents NPC stats from being skewed.
 
**Important:**
- Harder New Vegas Strip Access
- Loot Assist - Makes looting and holding onto crafting items way less tedious.
- Universal Water Bottling - Preferred water bottling system. A tweaked plugin to make each bottle require a cap to bottle is present in the mod-share Discord channel in Sweets server. Bottle return in Sweet Consumables is recommended to be set to off - there's tons of bottles in the game, so this gives a reason to continue to be picked up.
- Simpler Realism
- Immersive Minigames - Preferred minigame bypass. Use alongside Sweet's Immersive Minigame Tweaks.
- Mr House Assassins
- Desert Natural Weathers - Best weather mod.
- CC - Rain
- Interior Rain
- Charisma Affects Reputation - Charisma always needs boosts to be more important.
 
**Content:**
- More Mojave - Great locations in areas that could really use them.
- The Living Desert - Very high quality, sdds much needed population. Use with Sweet's patch.
- Vault 22 Floral Overhaul (Qolore Version) - Dramatically improves vibes of one of the coolest locations in the game.
- The Great Mojave Interior Overhaul
- A World Of Pain FO3 (With Sweet Pain) - Adds an enormous amount of dungeons and lots of playtime in high quality locations.
- A World of Pain Revised (With Sweet Pain NV) - Adds an enormous amount of dungeons and lots of playtime in high quality locations. Extraordinarily important to fill out NV's otherwise rather empty worldspace with more things to do.
- Mojave Raiders - Fills out worldspace with much needed encounters.
- Mojave Wildlife (FO3-Style) - Fills out worldspace with much needed encounters.
- Faction Wasteland Presence
- Real Weapon Mods (My Version)
- Rob-Co Craft-O-Matic Suite (My Version)
